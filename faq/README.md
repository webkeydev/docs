## Is Webkey Secure?
Yes, we can provide high security. In the last 10 years with multiple developments we have created a secure environment for Webkey App. Browser and Webkey client both use SSL communication.

## How can I manage more than one device?
We have more options for the application. Service provided for individual users is to be able to control one device remotely but in case you would like to control more than 1, Business and Enterprise option is the best one for you. With a monthly fee, you can control countless devices remotely easily.

## No Don't Show again option

"Don't show again" option not shown on device when screen mirroroing: we were notified that when screen mirroring is selected by clicking "Start Now" on the phone, the "Don't show again" option is gone. Please note that this option was removed from Android 10 by Google. Our advise is just to ignore the reminder window that pops up with the "Don't Show again" option, and just click "Start Now" to start mirroring the screen.
