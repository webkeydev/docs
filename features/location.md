# Location tracking
This feature of Webkey allows you to track multiple android devices via GPS, enabling you to dynamically change devices based on the environment they are travelling into, among many other possibilities. Further, this tool is capable of tracking devices to show where they have travelled and plot them on a map to give you useful insights.
