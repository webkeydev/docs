# List applications
###### When you are managing a device from afar, it is useful to have one place where all the apps on the given devices are listed. When you have set-up Webkey and connected your device to your account, you may just do that from your Dashboard. Letâ€™s see how it is done! 

After you have opened your Dashboard (https://webkeyapp.com/dashboard/devices) you should select your device.

After this, on the right hand side of the screen, you will see a couple of Webkey features with their corresponding icons. Click on apps to bring up the list on your device - example shown above. 

As you will see, the list will give you an option to search directly for an app, but you may also browse the installed apps. 
In the list, you will be able to check the version that is currently installed on the device - a useful information if you are managing a fleet of devices.

You will also be able to launch any app by clicking the Launch button - once you clicked on this, you need to navigate back to control to use the app, but in the meantime, the app will already be running on the device.
