# File Explorer
File explorer: Webkey allows you to navigate through and manage the files stored on your Android devices just as you would be holding the device in your hand. This feature is a must if you would like to store and display materials or information on your devices without having to manage them locally. If for example you would like to display a certain image, like an ad or an information, this tool will allow you to open the file remotely on the device. What is more, together with the GPS tracking feature, you can change what is displayed on your device based on the geographic location of the give device. The only limitation is the deviceâ€™s storage capacity and the strength of the connection. Available on all editions and does not require a rooted device.
