# Control
Webkey lets you control your device remotely and fully - this means that the device will react just the same way as when it is controlled manually. Remote control in Webkey includes all touch and key events. This is a key feature that can be used for among other things  for remote troubleshooting or educational purposes, just to name a few. Touch screen movements in the centralized web Dashboard are controlled by the mouse or touchpad and the keypad is used for the text input. This feature requires a rooted device (but works without root on Samsung devices)
